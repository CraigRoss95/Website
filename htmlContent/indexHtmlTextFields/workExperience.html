    The projects that I worked on in college gave me the tools that I needed to start at my first position.
    My first position in the software industry was as a Junior Developer at a small company called DonorView.
    The development team handled everything from new features and bug fixes to data management and tech support.
    To read more about my experience at DonorView and other projects I have worked on please see the “<a href="./portfolio">Portfolio</a>” tab.
