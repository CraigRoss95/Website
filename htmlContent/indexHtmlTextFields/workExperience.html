    My most recent experience was at a position for a fintech company called FIS, working on a microservice that tokenism customer transactions.
    It was at FIS where I learned a majority of my software engineering skills I know today. I picked up some valuable skills, such as what it is 
    like to work under the hood of an API, how to test production level code, and how to manage the scaling and deployment of my work.
