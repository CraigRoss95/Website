    I graduated from Newton North High School in 2014 with an engineering certificate.
    During my time at Newton North I also was the Teacher's Assistant for a
    drafting and 3D modeling course. After I graduated in 2014 I then attend Bridgewater State
    University, where I then graduated in 2019. During my time at Bridgewater
    State University, I took several courses which taught me a bulk of what I know today.
    The courses that are relevant to my field are compiled in the list below:
