    My name is Craig Ross. I am a Software Engineer from Newton, Massachusetts with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, 
    and I am currently looking to continue my career in the Software Industry. I am always looking for new opportunities to 
    expand my skill set weather it be how to use new software tools or fixing things around the house. In my free time I enjoy 
    cooking, reading, and working on projects posted on my <a href="https://github.com/CraigRoss95/">GitHub</a>. 
    Please contact me via <a href="mailto: craigross.emailme@gmailmail.com">email</a> for any possible job prospects.
