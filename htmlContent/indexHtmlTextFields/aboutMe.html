    My name is Craig Ross. I am a programmer from Newton, Massachusetts with a Bachelor's degree 
    in Computer Science. I am currently looking to continue my career in the Software Development 
    Industry. I am always looking for new opportunities to expand my skill set and to learn how to 
    use new tools. In my free time I enjoy cooking, reading, and working on new software projects. 
    I look forward to fulfilling my fullest potential and to working on future projects.
