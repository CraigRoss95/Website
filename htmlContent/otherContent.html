                My family is very important, they have helped me through thick and thin,
                I am eternally grateful for them, and I would not trade them for anything.

                my sister, mother, brother, father, and myself.

                <ul>
                    <li>3 cups dry navy beans boiled for one hour, then skimmed, and then drained</li>
                    <li>1 ½ cups ketchup</li>
                    <li> 1 ½ cups water</li>
                    <li> ¼ cup molasses</li>
                    <li> 1 large onion, chopped</li>
                    <li> 1 Tbsp dry mustard</li>
                    <li> 1 tsp salt</li>
                    <li> 6 slices thick cut bacon, cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
                    <li> ¾ cup brown sugar</li>

                Baked beans are a Bostonian staple and one of my favorites.
                This is a modified recipe that I use from AllRecipes that I got after some experimenting.
                Just throw everything above into a crockpot, mix it up until the homogeneous is homogonus, and let it sit on high for 6-10 hours.
                The longer you wait the sweeter and softer the beans will get.

                This is Dixie, my dog.
                She is a fawn boxer, and she was found by my uncle near a dumpster in Georgia during the summer of 2017.
                She is a good girl, 1 click = 1 pet
