    My dad ran a DJ business as a side gig when I was younger, I remember helping him with events for my school all the time in middle school. 
    Nowadays we only really do the church picnic and other events for family members. We used to have a bulky amp and chest we would need to bring to events, 
    the discs and the implements to use them wound up taking up half the space in our van. After I found a way to run our speakers over a small amp I bought online, 
    I looked into using a laptop with all of the songs I had sitting on my NAS. I found a tool called Virtual DJ and I was blown away by the features. Being able to set up a 
    playlist and have it auto fade was a great quality of life feature and I am glad I was able to get everything hooked up.
