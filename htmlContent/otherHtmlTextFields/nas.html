<p>I started scanning old family media back in early 2023, my dadâ€™s DJ discs. My parents photo albums, 
old VHS tapes, and old family documents are all on the list of media to rip. After amassing nearly a terabyte of data I decided
 I needed a place to put it all, so I ran to my local Micro Center to gather parts for a new computer to host it on. My system runs
  trueNAS Scale as an operating system with a RAID1 system for redundancy. On top of that I use Plex to stream the videos to my houses
   smart devices. I am glad I was able to preserve some of these pieces of media before something happened to them. Some pictures and
    videos are from years before my birth. Looking at some of these pictures is kind of like looking into a memory of a time or place
     I had never been, I want to be able to preserve that feeling for my ancestors some day.</p>
