    This is Dixie, our family dog. She is a fawn boxer-bulldog mix that my uncle found by a dumpster in Georgia during the summer of 2017. 
    Dixieâ€™s hobbies include sleeping, begging at the table, and receiving belly rubs. Please click the image to give her a pat on the head, 
    she is a good girl.
