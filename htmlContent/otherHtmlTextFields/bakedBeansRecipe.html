    Baked beans are a Bostonian staple and one of my favorites.
    This is a modified recipe that I use from some website I found that I got after some experimenting with different recipes.
    Just throw everything above into a crockpot, mix it up until thoroughly together, and let it sit on high for 8-10 hours.
    The longer you wait the sweeter and softer the beans will get, I have let these beans go over night and they still come out great.
    I also usually do a double recipe and freeze the extras in half recipe sizes, these beans are a great thing to pull out for summer BBQs
