    Baked beans are a Bostonian staple and one of my favorites.
    This is a modified recipe that I use from AllRecipes that I got after some experimenting.
    Just throw everything above into a crockpot, mix it up until the homogeneous is homogonus, and let it sit on high for 6-10 hours.
    The longer you wait the sweeter and softer the beans will get.
