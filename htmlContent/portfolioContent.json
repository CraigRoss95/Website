Apocablocalypse was my first time working on a project concurrently with other teammates using source control. The tools we used then are the same tools that I would use on later projects. These tools include: Git, Unity, and Trello. This was the first time in my career as a programmer that I really felt like I was collaborated with me peers. As a perk of being roommates with my team members I could give and receive feedback from across the room. This project was a very important turning point in my career; up until this point I had worked alone on all of my projects. When I worked in a group we were always pair programming. I was afraid that software engineering was going to be a very solitary job. What this project taught me is, that with proper source control, working together on software can greatly improve the quality of not only the code, but the experience of crafting software as a whole.",

The game was originally going to be eight rooms long, however after development started, the project quickly grew to a nearly forty room long game. The requirements for this project were to make a text based adventure game that utilized Object Oriented Programing. This project showed me the importance of building a good foundation for your project. A good foundation allows for conventions like inheritance and new features down the road. In the Summer of 2019, I went back and ported the game from Linux to Windows so I could get it running on my desktop and add it to my GitHub. ",
